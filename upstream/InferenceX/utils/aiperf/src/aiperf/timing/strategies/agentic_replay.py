"""AgenticReplayStrategy - trajectory-driven trace replay timing strategy.

Phase-aware timing strategy for the ``agentic_replay`` timing mode (spec §4.2).

Each trajectory is a wall-clock snapshot of a trace at a sampled instant t*
(25-75% through the trace's recorded duration). Every stream (root + each
subagent chain) splits at t*: turns before t* are history, turns at/after t*
are profiled.

WARMUP: for every session active (mid-flight) at t*, replay its last request
before t* (turn ``next_turn_index - 1``) as a session start. The chat prefix
is rebuilt worker-side by ``UserSession.advance_turn``, and what it reproduces
is context-mode dependent: under ``DELTAS_WITH_RESPONSES`` (the weka default)
it back-seeds the earlier turns so the warmup request carries the full prefix
and primes the server cache to the stream's state at t*; under
``DELTAS_WITHOUT_RESPONSES`` the prior turns are not seeded (live responses
aren't captured yet), so only that turn's delta is sent and the t* prefix is
not reproduced. This includes parents gated on a child join (they sent turn
n-1 before t* and resume at the join turn during PROFILING, so n-1 warms that
turn). Streams whose first request is at/after t* (``next_turn_index == 0``)
have nothing to warm. By default the priming
requests are SPREAD -- aligned globally on t* so every trajectory's t* lands
at the warmup end (see ``_execute_warmup``); ``--burst-phase-starts`` fires
them all at once instead. The phase exits via the standard
``SendingCompleteStopCondition`` plus ``grace_period_sec=inf`` semantics
already in CreditPhaseConfig (count-driven: every turn-n-1 must return).

Warmup-failure accumulation: terminal failures (``credit_return.error`` or
``credit_return.cancelled``) on a WARMUP credit's final turn are routed by
``CreditCallbackHandler`` into ``record_warmup_failure(trace_id)``. At
WARMUP teardown, ``PhaseRunner`` calls ``report_warmup_failures()`` which
raises ``TrajectoryWarmupFailedError`` if any failures were recorded. This
aborts PROFILING so steady-state metrics aren't silently biased by a
degraded trajectory pool.

PROFILING: each stream resumes at its first turn at/after t*
(``next_turn_index``). Dispatch times are normalized so the trajectory's
earliest post-t* request fires at profiling-time 0 and all other requests
preserve their recorded relative offsets; subsequent turns honor trace
inter-turn ``delay_ms`` (already clamped upstream in the loader). Gated
parents fire their join turn when blocking children complete. When a root
session reaches its final turn, its trace_id is recycled FIFO-style and a
fresh session (starting at turn 0) is spawned from the next trace_id in the
queue.
