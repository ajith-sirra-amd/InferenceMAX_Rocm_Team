"""Regression: agentic mid-trace resume acquires/releases the session slot balanced.

Session-slot symmetry contract (issuer.py): a session slot is acquired on a
session's first credit in the phase and released on its final turn.

Agentic replay resumes a sampled trajectory at ``turn_index = k_i + 1`` (>= 1)
in PROFILING, so the resumed root's first PROFILING credit has ``turn_index > 0``.
The FIX flags that credit ``is_session_start=True`` (via
``SampledSession.build_turn_at_index``), so ``CreditIssuer.issue_credit``
acquires a session slot for it (``needs_session_slot = is_session_start and not
is_child``). On the root's final turn
``CreditCallbackHandler._release_slots_for_return`` releases it, keeping the
session semaphore balanced.

Before the fix the resume credit acquired NO slot (the gate was
``turn_index == 0``) yet the final-turn release still fired, over-releasing the
(unbounded ``asyncio.Semaphore``) session limiter and admitting sessions above
``--concurrency``. Agentic replay enables the session limiter
(config.py sets ``concurrency=loadgen.concurrency`` for both phases), so the
over-subscription was real.
